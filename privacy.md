# aubot Privacy

Due to the nature of aubot, intermediate access to message content is required for trigger detection. No end user content is stored persistently at any time and is immediately removed from our systems after being processed.

Server data (name, ID, owner ID) is stored temporarily in RAM for analytics and functional purposes and may be removed at any time by kicking/removing the bot from your server.

Some role and user IDs may be optionally stored by self-hosters to restrict usage of the bot. This, unfortunately, is not controlled by us and you must bring it up with the self-hoster.
